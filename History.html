                <p>Knitting has a long and fascinating history that originated in the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean around the 11th or 12th century. The earliest knitted artifacts are Egyptian socks from that era. Knitting then spread to Europe, where male guilds used it to make religious garments. Gradually, it became an ubiquitous and critical aspect of daily life, practiced by people of all genders and cultural backgrounds, and cherished as a means of providing warmth and comfort through hand-crafted clothing and blankets. Over time, knitting was passed down from generation to generation and evolved to reflect the unique cultural influences of various regions.</br></p>

                <p>Before knitting, there was a needlework technique known as Nålbinding, (a Norwegian word meaning “needle binding”). Nålbinding creates a fabric similar to knitting by looping and knotting yarn with a single needle. It is often associated with the Vikings, but it was also practiced in other parts of the world. Archaeologists have found nålbinding fragments dating from various periods, such as 10,000 years ago in Israel, 7,750 BCE in Germany, the 5th or 6th century CE in Egypt, and the 9th or 10th century CE in Norway.</br></p>

                <p>Another precursor to knitting was finger knitting, which is a simple form of knitting done using only the fingers instead of needles. Finger knitting has been practiced for centuries, especially by children and those who did not have access to needles.</br></p>

                <p>These early forms of needlework laid the foundation for the development of knitting as it is known today.</br></p>

                <p>Over time, knitting spread throughout the world and became popular in Europe, particularly in Scandinavian countries (close to our hearts, naturally), where it was used to create intricate patterns for clothing, blankets, and other household items.</br></p>

                <p>The use of high-capacity knitting machines during the Industrial Revolution did make it easier to produce large quantities of knitwear. (Fun fact: knitting machines were first used in the late 1500s.) However, hand-knitting persisted as a beloved and widely-practiced craft, enjoyed by people from all walks of life. The rise of online communities such as Ravelry and social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook has facilitated greater connection and exchange between knitters, making it easier for them to share patterns and be inspired by one another.</br></p>
